You can directly open 2048.py once your computer knows Python or the platform mentioned before.

HOW TO PLAY:
In a 4x4 matrix, you can move all numbers to one direction with inputting w/s/a/d, which represent up/down/left/right, respectively, and equal two number encountered will add up, increasing score. Each move is counted as a turn.

If there is no empty square and no further steps can be made, you lose. Please type 'retry' to play again or 'retry 'at any time you want a new round.

Input 'esc' will exit the program or just click the close button.

Have fun(¡¨'¨Œ'¡¨)

KNOWN problems:
1, I coded it on the shell of Python, so it doesn't have any gorgerous graphics, that is why the play method is input a message and then press Enter, and that is also why I now start using engines to develop my further programs.
2, when the grid is full and player continues inputting, the 'while' loop will be troublesome and thus player should reopen 2048.py to play.
